# Data & Validation

> Read when: working with TypeScript types, Valibot schemas, forms, API data, or error handling.

## TypeScript rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| `any` | Forbidden as a variable, prop, or return type. Only permitted as a bound in a generic: `<T extends Record<string, any>>`. Escalate to a human if needed elsewhere. |
| `as` casting | Forbidden except for external library types that are provably wrong. |
| `interface` | Forbidden. Use `type` for everything — props, object shapes, API responses, store state, unions, intersections. |
| Inference | Let TypeScript infer where the type is obvious. No redundant annotations. |

---

## API response types — schema first, always

Define the Valibot schema first. Infer the TypeScript type from it using `InferOutput`. This keeps type and runtime validation permanently in sync.

```ts
// schemas/vehicle.schema.ts
import { object, string, number, pipe, url } from "valibot";
import type { InferOutput } from "valibot";

export const vehicleSchema = object({
  id: string(),
  plate: string(),
  year: number(),
  imageUrl: pipe(string(), url()),
});

// types/vehicle.type.ts
import type { InferOutput } from "valibot";
import { vehicleSchema } from "@/features/vehicles/schemas/vehicle.schema";

export type Vehicle = InferOutput<typeof vehicleSchema>;
```

**Rules:**
- Schema lives in `schemas/[name].schema.ts`. Type lives in `types/[name].type.ts`.
- Never write a `type` for an API response without a corresponding Valibot schema.
- Validate at the boundary — parse API responses in the service layer before returning data to the query.
- Never pass raw, unvalidated API data into the rest of the app. If the shape is wrong, the parse throws — that is correct behaviour.

```ts
// services/vehicle.service.ts
async function getVehicle(params: GetVehicleParams): Promise<Vehicle> {
  const { data } = await axiosBasic.get("/vehiculos", { params });
  return parse(vehicleSchema, data); // throws if shape is wrong
}
```

## Validation (Valibot)

Valibot is the only validation library. Do not use Zod or Yup.

- Use `.check()` for all custom validation logic. **Never use `.refine()`.**
  - Why: `.refine()` bypasses Valibot's type inference chain and creates runtime overhead. `.check()` is the type-safe equivalent. If `.check()` cannot express the logic, escalate to a human.
- Write validation error messages as clear, user-facing prose — they render directly in the UI.

```ts
// ❌ Wrong — not user-facing
{ message: "validation.required.field" }

// ✅ Correct — readable prose
{ message: "Este campo es requerido" }
{ message: "Ingresa una placa válida" }
```

## Form management

**React Hook Form** with `@hookform/resolvers` is the standard. Use it for all form logic and validation integration.

Use `valibotResolver` from `@hookform/resolvers/valibot` to connect RHF with Valibot schemas — do not wire validation manually.

For complete form conventions — file structure, `Controller` vs `register`, Maskito integration, server error wiring — see `docs/when/forms.md`.

## Error handling hierarchy

Errors flow through a defined hierarchy. Each layer owns one responsibility.

```
Axios interceptor
  → Catches HTTP errors
  → Normalises them into a typed error object
  → Throws the normalised error

TanStack Query
  → Propagates the thrown error via query error state
  → Never swallows or transforms errors

Component layer
  → Fatal / unrecoverable errors    → React Error Boundary (full fallback UI)
  → Recoverable errors (user retry) → Toast notification
  → Field-specific errors           → Inline, below the field
```

### Decision rule for UI

| Situation | Pattern |
|---|---|
| User cannot continue without resolving the error | Error Boundary |
| User can retry or dismiss and continue | Toast |
| Error is specific to a field or input | Inline |

This hierarchy connects directly to the UI contracts in `docs/when/ui-library.md`.
