## Overrides

- **No Axios** — this project uses native `fetch` wrapped in a thin typed helper at
  `src/lib/http.lib.ts`. Do not introduce Axios. The `docs/when/api-layer.md` Axios
  rules do not apply; use the patterns in `docs/local/api-layer.md` instead.

---

## Local rules

- See `docs/local/api-layer.md` for the `fetch`-based HTTP conventions used in this project.
- See `docs/local/quote-flow.md` for step orchestration — the multi-step quote flow has
  non-obvious state transitions that diverge from the standard store pattern.

---

## Agent notes

- Env vars are in `.env.local` (never committed). The required keys are documented in
  `.env.example` at the repo root.
- The `src/features/quote/stores/quote.store.ts` store is the single source of truth for
  the entire quote flow. Do not duplicate quote state in component-local state.
- The backend returns `camelCase` — no transformation layer needed.
- E2E tests in `tests/e2e/` require a running dev server (`pnpm dev`) before running
  `pnpm test:e2e`.

stop and report to a human before proceeding.
